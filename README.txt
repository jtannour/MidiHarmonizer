This was my final project for an AI course involving fuzzy logic. It takes a simple midi song and harmonizes it.

===================
HOW TO RUN	  |
===================

You need to have JFugue as an external library in order for the project to run properly.

If you’re using eclipse you can add the library again by right clicking on the project and click on build path and clicking on 
configure build path. Once there you can add the JFugue.jar as an external JAR.


After that running the code is very simple just compile and run the Harmonizer class.

A GUI will pop up with some options of what you can do. 
The combobox let’s you chose which songs you would like to harmonize (I have 2 that are hard coded in) or you can also choose to 
upload your own midi file.

This hasn’t been tested with many midi files and will only work on simple tunes that aren’t already harmonized.

Once a song is selected you can decide to play the song, play the harmonized version minus the original song or 
play the full harmonized song.
